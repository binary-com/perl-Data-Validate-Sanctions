# NAME

Data::Validate::Sanctions - Validate a name against sanctions lists

# SYNOPSIS

    # as exported function
    use Data::Validate::Sanctions qw/is_sanctioned get_sanction_file set_sanction_file/;
    set_sanction_file('/var/storage/sanction.csv');

    print 'BAD' if is_sanctioned($first_name, $last_name);

    # as OO
    use Data::Validate::Sanctions;

# DESCRIPTION

Data::Validate::Sanctions is a simple validitor to validate a name against sanctions lists.

The list is from [https://www.treasury.gov/ofac/downloads/sdn_xml.zip](https://www.treasury.gov/ofac/downloads/sdn_xml.zip), [https://www.treasury.gov/ofac/downloads/consolidated/consolidated.xml](https://www.treasury.gov/ofac/downloads/consolidated/consolidated.xml), and [http://hmt-sanctions.s3.amazonaws.com/sanctionsconlist.csv](http://hmt-sanctions.s3.amazonaws.com/sanctionsconlist.csv)

run [update\_sanctions\_csv](https://metacpan.org/pod/update_sanctions_csv) to update the bundled csv.

The path of list can be set by function ["set\_sanction\_file"](#set_sanction_file) or by method ["new"](#new). If not set, then environment variable $ENV{SANCTION\_FILE} will be checked, at last
the default file in this package will be used.

# METHODS

## is\_sanctioned

    is_sanctioned($last_name, $first_name);
    is_sanctioned($first_name, $last_name);

when one string is passed, please be sure last\_name is before first\_name.

or you can pass first\_name, last\_name (last\_name, first\_name), we'll check both "$last\_name $first\_name" and "$first\_name $last\_name".
